# GameProfile
This is the multi-faced in-game profile system in Garry's Mod. It allows you to create your own profile, which you can customize as you wish. And additional elements of this addon, like achievements (and many more in the future) allows you to get the most interesting experience by creating a unique profile to show players.

Console command to open the menu: `gameprofile_menu`

## Additional information
- I recommend [adding an addon with content](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3152678466) to your workshop collection so you don't have any problems
- Addon is integrated with the gang system. If a person is a member of a gang, his profile shows an additional panel of information about it. If you would like to put this system on as well, you can [download FatedGang here](https://github.com/darkfated/FatedGang)
